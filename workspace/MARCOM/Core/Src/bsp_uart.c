/** TODO: Task 1 - UART
 *
 * The main purpose of the functions here is to offer implementation for the logging functions
 * in log.c and also allow mainloop.c to receive bytes one by one.
 *
 * In order to initialize the module, the GPIO pins (alternate function, push-pull etc.)
 * and the UART peripheral (baud rate, stop bits etc.) must be initialized.
 * To do this, we use the graphical configurator in the MARCOM.ioc file and
 * call the generated initialization function here in the UART_Init() function.
 *
 * The string sending has to be implemented in UART_SendString() function.
 * We use non-blocking, interrupt-based transfer method in order not to block the rest of the system.
 *
 * After implementing these functions, take a look at the UART frame using the oscilloscope (PD8 pin).
 * Put a screenshot in the report where the beginning and the end of the frame is visible.
 * Try to decode the meaning of each bit and the transmitted byte.
 * Measure the baud rate with the cursor function of the oscilloscope.
 * Please pay extra attention not to short circuit any of the pins!
 * Use the RS-232 connectorâ€™s screw as the ground point.
 *
 *
 * TODO: Task 2 - UART reception (part 1)
 *
 * This task is about receiving data from UART because the previous task only contains transmission.
 * UART receive is implemented using interrupts.
 * HAL library provides a uniform structure for handling interrupts. Most of the interrupt handling
 * is implemented in HAL which provides callbacks for the user code that actually deals with the
 * business logic.
 *
 * First the interrupt event forces the microcontroller to save its state and jump to the
 * address corresponding the event source in the interrupt vector table. The address is read
 * from here, written to the PC. This address contains the native interrupt handler
 * (such as USART3_IRQHandler() ) which is independent from HAL.
 * In order to utilize HAL, the programmer must call the HAL interrupt handler to take care of
 * the interrupt (HAL_UART_IRQHandler(&huart3); ). This is done automatically by the generated
 * code in stm32f4xx_it.c.
 * The interrupt handler function of HAL will call back to a user implemented function
 * depending on the situation. If a complete receive transaction finished, it calls the
 * HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback() function.
 * In this task bytes are received one by one. The received byte is saved to
 * lastReceivedUartCommand global variable, which is monitored and handled by mainloop.c.
 * For this reason the second part of this task is implemented in mainloop.c.
